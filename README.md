# Pokémon: The "Extended" Pokédex

### Term group project for CPSC 583: Information Visualization.
As a group we were tasked with finding an interesting dataset to work with and visualize effectively. We decided on using a dataset on Pokémon found on *Kaggle*. This dataset would be used to create an interactive dashboard that conveyed some decided upon information.

We used the *D3.js* library to create our visualizations. The goal of the dashboard was to have a centralized location where knowledgable players of the game can go to search out and compare two different Pokémon and their attributes.
